title: GPT-3 Playground (Alpha)
description: |
  Use GPT3 to help analyze your documents, right within DocumentCloud. Note
  that this Add-On consumes AI credits, which you can get via a Pro or Organization
  account.
  
  
  **Note**: This Add-On uses 14 credits per document analyzed.

  Give this a full prompt that you would pass into GPT-3 and it will run it
  against your selected documents, one at a time. The plug in only looks at the first page
  of a document currently. If you define a custom model, [use the naming
  conventions from this section](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3).
  The prompt refers to the user input as the "Assignment," the document's text
  as "Document Text", and GPT-3's generated response as the "Answer," which can
  be helpful when defining your prompt.
